# KI Admin Panel

Welcome to the KI Admin Panel project! First of all this is a Tattle ;-)
When you use a docker an mount a Windows directory watchdog doesn't send any events.
So this app runs locally on a Windows PC an tattles all these events towards an API.
And if the app already exists, you can also do a few admin things.
Have fun
